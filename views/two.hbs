			When a leading South African retail group came to Breakpoint to streamline its
			IT infrastructure, we implemented a powerful hyper-converged solution that
			transformed its IT operations. IT silos were collapsed to create one neat and invisible
			infrastructure solution, freeing up a quarter of its IT resources for other
			business initiatives, and saving millions of Rand on support, downtime and maintenance
			costs. Software defined storage services and applications could for the
			first time be run on the same servers, and computation and storage were integrated
			into single x86 based servers deployed in scale-out clusters.
			This all-inone solution from Nutanix, a global enterprise cloud provider, reduced power,
			space and cooling requirements in the datacentre, ultimately lowering costs and
			freeing up 25% of their IT resources. The system is automated and manageable
			from one screen, vastly simplifying the management of these resources. </p>

			Breakpoint has the highest certified Nutanix sales team in the region and our

			Seeking a similar solution, a Zambian telco came to Breakpoint to install and implement
			an economical openstack cloud solution leveraging commodity servers
			and storage to build its own private cloud solution. Constrained by the local Protection
			of Personal Information Act, Breakpoint provided a local company with
			the methodology to build a software-defined cloud solution that the client needed,
			and which enabled it to provide local cloud services to local customers at
			good prices.
